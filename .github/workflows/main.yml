# This is a basic workflow to help you get started with Actions

name: CI

# Controls when the action will run. 
on: push
  # Triggers the workflow on push or pull request events but only for the master branch
  # push:

  # pull_request:
  #   branches: [ main ]


# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  # This workflow contains a single job called "build"
  build:
    # The type of runner that the job will run on

      matrix:
        node-version: [10.x, 12.x, 14.x, 15.x]

    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
    steps:
      # Checks-out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so your job can access it

      # Runs a single command using the runners shell
